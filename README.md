# CookieMonsterFactory
First project from Data Structures course

The idea is to simulate a cookie factory process. In the process there are some machines running with a communication with each other. So the idea is to use Queue data structure to simulate the conveyor belts from each machine as a form of communication or requests.

This app is built in with QT Creator
